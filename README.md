<img src="Images/AboutMe.png"/>
<p>AI enthusiast & full-stack developer with a passion for building smart, end-to-end applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve developed AI-powered apps from the ground up â€” like <strong>Nutrisha</strong>, an AI nutritionist, that uses FHIR patientsâ€™ health data to generate personalized diet plans and analyze meal images, and <strong>FoodFighters</strong>, an AI gamified app, that transforms nutrition from a chore into a game, making healthy eating accessible, engaging, and community-driven.</p>
<p>My journey started in Russia, where I won the national Big Change 2021 competition and became a WorldSkills finalist in Software Solutions for Business, receiving a $20,000 award. Since then, Iâ€™ve built desktop, web, and mobile apps with modern stacks like React, Node.js, TypeScript, Python, MongoDB and more.</p>
<p>After completing the Computer Programming program at Seneca Polytechnic, Iâ€™m now actively seeking full-time software engineering rolesâ€”especially where I can keep building powerful, human-centered AI solutions.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s make tech easier, better, faster.</p>
